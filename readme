React Assessment Implementation

## Description

This project is an implementation of an assessment that includes three different requirements. It involves designing a picture using HTML and CSS, component communication between two components (A and B), and conditional styling based on a Boolean value.

## Requirements

1. Designing the Picture:

   - A circle shape is created using HTML and styled with CSS.
   - A button is added, which increases a counter and changes the background color of the button when clicked. The updated counter value is displayed within the circle.

2. Component Communication (Components A and B):

   - Component A contains a variable called "cendol" with an initial value of 2.
   - The value of "cendol" is passed from component A to component B as a prop to display it.
   - Component B includes a button that, when clicked, increments the "cendol" value by 10, which is received from component A.

3. Conditional Styling Based on a Boolean Value:
   - There is a variable that holds a Boolean value.
   - A button is present, and its styling is based on the value of the Boolean variable.
     - If the variable is true, the button's background color is set to red.
     - If the variable is false, the button's background color is set to blue.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open the project in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- After following the installation instructions, you can view and interact with the implemented features.
- Open the web application in your preferred web browser.
- Explore the designed picture and click the "Change Color" button to see the counter increase and the button color displayed within the circle.
- In the component communication example, observe how the value of "cendol" in component B is initially set to 2 from component A and increments by 10 when the button in component B is clicked.
- In the conditional styling example, the button's background color is determined based on the Boolean variable. You can click the button to toggle between the red and blue background colors.
